Welcome to Hame's documentation!
================================

**Hame** (Hydrogen atom matrix element) is a Python library to compute one-photon
and two-photon matrix elements between eigenstates of the hydrogen atom.
It includes calculation of light-shifts of the two-photon transitions and the ionization rate
of the upper level of the transition. 
It uses a Sturmian basis to compute the matrix elements. It is based on the hydrogen atom dynmical group
presented in D. Delande, These d'Etat: Atomes de Rydberg en champs statiques intenses, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris),
1988 (in French) <https://theses.hal.science/tel-00011864v1>.
